excerpt: "This paper examines the impact of climate change on companies' misreporting behaviour. We find 
that companies with higher levels of climate change exposure are more likely to misreport their financial 
statements. We employ the fraud triangle to explore potential mechanisms underlying this behaviour. 
Climate change provides opportunities for misreporting, as it can significantly reduce accounting 
comparability due to the need for professional judgment in accounting treatments related to climate 
change, especially since Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) do not explicitly address 
climate-related issues. Through the pressure channel, companies facing greater climate exposure 
experience higher cash flow shortfalls, reduced revenue-generating capabilities, and increased 
insolvency risks, which might compel management to engage in misreporting to appease stakeholders, 
secure financing, or meet market expectations. This result is more pronounced in firms that possess 
higher asset tangibility, are smaller, face lower environmental litigation risks, issue fewer equity 
instruments in a given year, have high market leverage and are headquartered in regions where people 
have low climate change belief. Our research is the first study that shows the link between corporate misreporting behaviour and 
climate change. For policymakers, we highlight the need for accounting standard-setters to incorporate 
explicit guidelines on climate-related issues, underscoring a significant gap in current GAAP regulations."
